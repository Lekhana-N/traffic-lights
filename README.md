📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world Traffic Light System using a Raspberry Pi and the gpiozero Python library.

The system controls three LEDs:

🟢 Green

🟡 Amber (Yellow)

🔴 Red

It follows a timed traffic signal sequence similar to actual road intersections.

This project is ideal for:

Embedded systems learning

Smart city simulations

GPIO control practice

Traffic automation concepts

🛠️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python 3

🍓 Raspberry Pi

⚡ gpiozero library

💡 3 LEDs (Red, Amber, Green)

🔌 Resistors (220Ω recommended)

Breadboard & Jumper wires

🔌 GPIO Pin Configuration
Light	GPIO Pin
Green	GPIO 2
Amber	GPIO 3
Red	GPIO 4

📊 Output Behavior

Green light stays ON for 10 seconds

Amber indicates transition

Red stays ON for 10 seconds

Cycle repeats continuously
